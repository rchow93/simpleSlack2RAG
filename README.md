# simpleSlack2RAG
simpleSlack2RAG is a slackbot that you can add into your Slack Channel and offer RAG capabilities from a VectoreStore/Database to help answer your corporate questions. You will need to add a slack app. I'll be using the free tier Slack so I will avoid using workflows. 

In addition to knowledge retrieval, I'm currently working on Agentic Agent capabilities with a total of 5-6 Agent tools that can be utilized by the Agents. I will modularize the code to allow using OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM's while also supporting local LLM Inference with services like Ollama.
